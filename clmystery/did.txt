Mike Bostock seems a suspect, but it is not. It is a male, tall and
has all 4 subscriptions on the id cards.  It has a alibi. I found he
as suspect trying to check the interview by grep SkyMiles.

Found the woman that ran away after hearing the shoots. She had a very
good tip about the car of the man.
> Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"

> INTERVIEW
Home appears to be empty, no answer at the door.

After questioning neighbors, appears that the occupant may have left for a trip recently.

Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.


Maybe is him the murder?

CHECKED! IT'S HIM!

Problem solved, Jeremy Bowers is the assassin.
